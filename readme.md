# Explanation of project
This is a CNC-mill project. CNC-mill is made of cold-rolled steel laser cutted
and standard rolled metall. 
Cadquery project reimplementation. Study this awesome python library.
https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery

Initially I made CNC mill from scratch, with standard GUI CAD-software (SW, to be
explicit).
This repository is an attempt to reimplement CNC machine with python code and Cadquery library.
## Progress
